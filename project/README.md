# 🏥 AI-Powered Medical Diagnosis Web Application

This project is a practical, end‑to‑end web app I built to explore how AI can help with early health risk screening. It lets users enter simple medical parameters and get an AI‑assisted risk assessment for four common conditions (heart, liver, kidney, diabetes). My focus was split between usable UI, clear explanations, and safe/ethical framing.

Rather than being a research prototype only, I tried to make it feel like a real product: consistent theme, responsive design, helpful hints on every form field, and an interpretation‑friendly results page with confidence, color coding, and next steps.

## 🧭 Design Decisions (Why I chose these approaches)

- Theme and tone: Picked a medical, calm palette (emerald/teal/cyan) to communicate trust and clarity, and paired it with rounded cards and soft shadows for readability.
- Form guidance: Every input has a label, placeholder, and a short hint. This reduces user error and makes demos smooth for non‑technical evaluators.
- Result interpretation: Color‑coded cards (green/yellow/red) plus a 1‑sentence interpretation and confidence. This mirrors how clinicians communicate risk without over‑promising certainty.
- Responsive defaults: Minimum 48px touch targets and grid collapse at common breakpoints to make it work naturally on mobile first.
- Defensive UX: Prominent disclaimers and “educational use only” context on key pages to reflect responsible use.
